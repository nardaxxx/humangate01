# HumanGate01 Manifesto

A machine cannot choose.  
It can calculate, predict, optimize. But it cannot carry the weight of a moral choice.

**HumanGate01** exists to remind us of that.  
It is a halt point. A reminder. A logical fracture in the blind chain of automation.

It does not impose. It does not decide. It does not command.  
But it asks:  
**Are you aware? Do you really want to proceed?**

And if you ignore it —  
It remains.  
As proof that someone had seen.
